class User:
    """
    Base class for simulated user agents in the SimShop recommendation system.
    
    This class implements the core user behavior simulation framework where users
    react to recommended items through a two-stage decision process:
    1. Click decision: Based on whether item utility exceeds click_threshold
    2. Purchase decision: Probabilistic based on utility between click and buy thresholds
    
    The utility function defines how much a user likes an item (0-1 scale) and should
    be overridden by subclasses to implement specific user behaviors.
    
    Attributes:
        username (str): Unique identifier for the user
        click_threshold (float): Minimum utility score required for user to click an item
        buy_threshold (float): Utility score at which user has 100% probability to buy
    
    Note:
        - When utility >= click_threshold: User clicks the item
        - When click_threshold <= utility < buy_threshold: User buys with probability 
          proportional to how close utility is to buy_threshold
        - When utility >= buy_threshold: User always buys (100% probability)
